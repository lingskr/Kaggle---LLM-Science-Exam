Goal of the Competition
Inspired by the OpenBookQA dataset, this competition challenges participants to answer difficult science-based questions written by a Large Language Model.

Your work will help researchers better understand the ability of LLMs to test themselves, and the potential of LLMs that can be run in resource-constrained environments.
